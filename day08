DAY EIGHT

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. 

oh what joy in the morning!
that beyond all the smoke and
dead leaves lies the 
brilliance of a sunrise
that brings a second coming
each day!

i lie there, enjoying the 
feeling that there is still
hope for me, for us,
that I don't have to go
to the abyss of timelessness
without love.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.

a knocking noise of
loose belts
thumping vibrations
and deafening blah

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. 

the clover eaten
by the steer
before being
processed for a steak

------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.

absolute values
before the reaper
arrives
cannot psych out death

------------------------------------------------------------------------

5.

left out by elder
brother's selfishness
until,
of course, he's needed

------------------------------------------------------------------------

6.

there are no words to
describe the pain
descending
into the masses

------------------------------------------------------------------------
