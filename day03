DAY THREE

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.

playing a grown-ups
game of capture the flag
doesn't bode well
for one's movie career.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.

images received off carriage
smokes eyewitness earlier
incident listen
the causes of what happened

thoughts of what ignorant
speak nature authority early
on what occurred fall
another can hear us

dense smells of old piss
filth everywhere
danger in the air
i don't like subways

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.

at the moment outside the
plush hotel shows us the 
picture inside of caviar
riot police and bling
