DAY TWO

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.

My inner peace
is not dependent 
on outside factors
but on letting go.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.

he will win chaotic
while it is not known
whether the twist
will air like planned

not another one will
be another rumor
this time before the
bell tolls

i feel the electricity
noise loud
a response that is
grabbing at junk

clock on the dresser
never running ticking
tocking a dust collector
long since running slow

progress lasted managing
to the tide rolling in
a smear of fingerprint
enlarging on the glass
